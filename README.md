This zip contains both parts and the assembly of the prototype design, of a 3d printer. What is special about this 3d printer, is its ability to
print ,theoretically,indefinitely along the z axis. 
It is a mechanical engineering student project and i hope to help others willing to make something similar, have a basis.

NOTE that this is not the final design of the 3d printer, which differs and is far more detailed than this.
